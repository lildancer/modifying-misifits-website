    <h2> Paths you can take </h2>
       <p> 	Ladies and Gents there are three things you should know when picking a path at this fork. You can either enter the past, or take a jump a few dozen years into the future. You participating in a story of the stars. Discover what happens when a sail undertakes a journey bigger than the universe. If you take this path you’re in for a whirlwind of confusion as Vela herself works to discover whether she wants to be the reason the world ends, or the reason the stars die.
  	The past is a rough place to be, especially when the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of a girl who doesn’t trust herself half as much as she trusts the directions her mother hid in her childhood stories. Caos lives up to her name as every aspect of her being is chaotic. She borders on psychotic as she rushes through life trying to follow the directions to a code that will stop the world she knows from falling into the past. This path is filled with raging emotions, threats, and a battle with only one side. Embarking on this journey breaks the line dividing the past from the future and saving a world from reversing on its end. </p>
         <p id = "travel" > Either path you take will be a tale you can’t hide. </p>

      <p class = "paragraph"> His words echoed in my mind as I ran through forest as fast and as quietly as possible. If I was going to escape through the portal it had to be now. There was no way I going to let them get me again, but I couldn't show them the way. </p>
      <p class = "paragraph"> <em>Snap.Crack.<em> Shoot!</p>
      <p class = "paragraph"> I growled under my breath and turned at a random tree heading back the way I came. With every hit of the branches I passed I began to lose energy and so in the milliseconds before I was back in his sites I jumped into a tree and waited.</p>
      <p class = "paragraph"> Not even a minute later he was under the tree, searching along the ground for any clue as to where I was.  I stopped breathing, and watched as he just stood there. </p>
      <p class = "paragraph"> He waited for a few minutes before finally continuing through the trees back the way we had come when he first started chasing me. </p>
      <p class = "paragraph"> I released my breath and sat in the tree before jumping through the trees to the waterfall. Once I reached the rock that jutted over the fall, keeping it hidden from those unaware of its existence I dropped to the ground. Breathing calmly I took a few steps back and dived into the algae covered water into a world I'd now officially called my own. </p>

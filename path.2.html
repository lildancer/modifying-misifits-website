        <p class="paragraph"> He began to tap his fingers along the bridge, legs swinging back and forth as he stared at me. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> "You don't like me. I get it, but you could be a little more helpful," I marched towards him and placed my hands on my hips. "I didn't ask you to come help me, so if you aren't going to be helpful you can leave." </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> He laughed. The biscuit laughed at me, and if it hadn't been for the fact my mama told me not to hit people who are laughing I'd have punched him.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> "You want help darling?," he stood up and walked towards me. "Here." Next thing I knew I was falling over the bridge. </p>

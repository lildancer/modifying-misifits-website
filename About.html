 <h2> The Creator's Tale </h2>

  <h3> It all started with a movie </h3>
    <p> My mother is obsessed with movies, almost as obsessed as she is with others stories. So it was no surprise that I've been watching films my whole life about books. It was also no surprise that I grew up to enjoy reading, which eventually led to my love of storytelling. My mother says we can blame <em> The Neverending Story</em> and <em>The Labyrinth</em> for the tales I began to sprout.</p>
  <h3> The Tales I Tell </h3>
    <p>When I was about knee high to a ducks butt I retold fairytales where the princess was the hero. As I got older my stories began to shift to tales of two sisters running off to a new land where anything could happen. Those stories eventually shifted to tales of new creatures no had ever heard about. The older I got the wilder and wilder the stories became. </p>
    <p> Outside of my interest in creating the unheard I began to explore the genre of romance. My romances however exhibited themselves in the style of dance stories as my love of dance seeped into my love of writing. As a Creative Writing major I've dabbled in a myriad of genres and as such have begun to write more and more.</p>
  <h3 > Portal to other Worlds </h3>
    <p> Other than this website, where snippets of whole stories as well as multiple short stories will begin to appear is wattpad. The site I've been using to read other upcoming authors and to storyboard my own stories. Not many are published and readable at the moment but more and more are appearing as I become more comfortable with others reading my work. If you want to check out one of my fiction stories rather than my mystical and fantasy, check out my page on Wattpad. Have fun reading- especially if its not my work. Christie out!</p>

         <h2> The Emergence of Syxiennna </h2>
           <p>Syxienna was originally born as a child. No lie. I was about 17 years old when I fell in love with the name I created and decided that was what my second girl was going to be named. My mother loathed the idea, and so it was no surprise that I tabled the idea. <p>
          <p> About a year after the idea was tabled I had a vision (not like a weird stop in time, dead to the world vision, but a daydream of a character I needed to write. That character didn’t have a name but the city she was in definitely did: Syxienna. In my vision Syxienna was a bustling town in disguise as an abandoned one. The buildings were decrepit on the outside but brand new on the inside. Nothing was as it seemed, although the average citizen was not aware of it. Initially, that was all I had. In fact that was all I had for weeks.No further ideas appeared for so long that I considered dropping the idea of Syxienna. </p>
          <p> For a while I was bummed. I had no where to put my unnamed characters and their bad habits. However, as I worked on my character for my pathfinder game at school, the rest of my city built itself before my eyes.I realized I didn’t need to build a home and then my character; the character needed to be crafted so she could tell me where she was from. </p>
          <p> My character created the world of Syxienna. As her personality grew, I was able to create a place she didn’t belong and the perfect city for her. From those two places that she would never see (except for in my brain) I molded a world that I then destroyed and used as a basis for my story.</p>
